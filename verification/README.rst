Nunavut Verification Suite
################################################

Nunavut has built-in support for several languages. Included with this is a suite of tests using typical test
frameworks and language compilers, interpreters, and/or virtual machines. While each release of Nunavut is
gated on automatic and successful completion of these tests this guide is provided to give system integrators
information on how to customize these verifications to use other compilers, interpreters, and/or virtual
machines.
