regulated.zubax.sensor.wattmeter.DCSample.0.1 power
# Total instant pack power. Low-pass filtering should be applied to avoid aliasing effects.
# Positive current flows from the battery to the load (discharging).
# Negative current flows into the battery (charging).

uavcan.si.unit.energy.Scalar.1.0 energy
# A pessimistic estimate of the amount of energy that can be reclaimed from the battery in its current state.
# This may be dependent on the state of charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), temperature, load profile, etc.
# Negative values may be reported to indicate overdischarge.
#
# The instant power consumption can be computed directly from the voltage and current measurements, or as
# the time derivative of estimated energy (dE/dt). The latter approach takes into accout other environmental
# factors that may affect the amount of reclaimable energy, so it may be preferable. Having the instant power,
# the time to depletion is estimated as (energy / power). When charging, the remaining time to full charge
# can be found similarly as ((full_energy - energy) / abs(power)).

# A pessimistic estimate of the amount of energy that can be reclaimed from a fully charged battery
# under the current conditions (SoH, temperature, load profile, etc).

# The minimum and maximum readings of the pack temperature sensors. For example, if a pack is equipped with
# three distributed temperature sensors that read [288, 258.15, 360.5] kelvin, the reported array value would be
# [258.15, 360.5].
# If there is only one temperature sensor, both elements shall be of the same value.
# If there are no temperature sensors, both elements shall be NaN.

bool charger_connected
# Whether the charging is in progress is observable though the reported instant current: a negative value
# indicates that the battery is being charged. Time to full charge can be derived from the energy estimate.

bool temperature_hot
bool temperature_cold

# The cells require rebalancing. This may be an indicator of deterioration of the battery.

bool balancing
# Cell balancing is currently in progress.

bool needs_service
# The battery requires other type of maintenance (not balancing).

bool bms_error
# Internal error in the battery management system, not related to the battery itself.
# Use vendor-specific interfaces to obtain further information.
