#
# Nested data type used for representing a network-wide synchronized timestamp with microsecond resolution.
# This data type is highly recommended for use both in standard and vendor-specific messages alike.
#

# Zero means that the time is not known.
uint56 UNKNOWN = 0

# The number of microseconds that have passed since some arbitrary moment in the past.
# The moment of origin (i.e., the time base) is defined per-application. The current time base in use
# can be requested from the time synchronization master, see the corresponding service definition.
#
# This value is to never overflow. The value is 56-bit wide because:
#
#   - 2^56 microseconds is about 2285 years, which is plenty. A 64-bit microsecond counter would be
#     unnecessarily wide and its overflow interval of 585 thousand years induces a mild existential crisis.
#
#   - CAN 2.0-based transports carry up to 7 bytes per frame. Time sync messages must use single-frame
#     transfers, which means that the value can't be wider than 56 bits.
